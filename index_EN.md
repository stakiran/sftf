## SFTF Framework: Kirano Classification
- A system that can classify SFTFs with relatively high accuracy
    - One system has four categories; these are called system modules
    - In the Kirano Classification, there are five system modules:
        - Recording, Applying, Driving, Acting, Processing
- You're free to create your own original system modules, but (if you follow the Kirano Classification) build them in units of "one module = four categories"
    - The number four strikes a good balance in terms of ease of understanding, ease of use, and classification accuracy

All modules are shown below.
